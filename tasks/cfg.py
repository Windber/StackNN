"""
Word prediction tasks based on CFGs. In each task in this module, the
neural network will read a sentence (sequence of words) and predict the
next word. We may specify a list of words that must be predicted by the
neural network. For example, if we specify that the controller must predict
verbs, then we only evaluate it based on the predictions made when the
correct answer is a verb.

Tasks are distinguished from one another based on how input and output
data are generated for training and testing. In all tasks below, the
data are generated by some sort of context-free grammar.
